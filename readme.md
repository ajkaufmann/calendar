Features
--------------
- Ability to share an event you are creating with another user by putting their username into the "Other user to share event with" field.
- Ability to look up the weather in your zipcode using the weather lookup bar by inputting your desired zipcode. We used the API from https://openweathermap.org/api for our weather tool.
- Ability to tag events as either work or leisure when creating them with the relevant radio buttons, and then filtering your calendar for either work events, leisure events, or both by clicking the relevant radio buttons next to the "Filter events by: " text.
